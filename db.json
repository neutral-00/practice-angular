      "text": "Streams allow you to treat data processing as a pipeline of functions, which is highly efficient for manipulating collections of objects. \nNo Mutation: Streams do not modify the original data source; they produce new streams with transformations applied.\nPipelining: Operations can be chained together (e.g., stream.filter().map().collect()). \nBy simply changing .stream() to .parallelStream(), you can leverage multi-core processors to process large datasets faster",

      "text": "Learning NgRx is highly beneficial for Angular developers, particularly when working on medium-to-large-scale applications. It provides a structured, predictable way to manage application state based on the Redux pattern, which helps address the complexity that arises when multiple components share data. By using immutable data structures and memoized selectors (which cache results), NgRx helps optimize rendering.",
